# Zyknow.Abp.FluentDesignUI

## Fluent Design UI for ABP
This project is developed based on .NET 9 and Abp 9.x, with the goal of replacing the original Blazor UI of Abp with FluentBlazor. Therefore, all UI components, layouts, and styles should use FluentBlazor instead of the native Abp Blazor components.
